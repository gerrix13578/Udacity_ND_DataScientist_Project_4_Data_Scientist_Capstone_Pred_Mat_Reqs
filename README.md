# Udacity_ND_DataScientist_Project_4_Data_Scientist_Capstone_Pred_Mat_Reqs
This repository contains a complete data science project focused on optimizing the Supply-to-Line process in automotive production. The goal is to analyze material request behavior at consumption points (PLPs) and predict the time between material requests using machine learning techniques.
